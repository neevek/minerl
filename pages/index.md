Andersson trees are simple and easy to implement balanced binary search trees that are based on the foundations of red black trees. Consequently, Andersson trees have similar performance and structuring properties as red black trees without the difficult implementation. Red black trees are an abstraction of the symmetric binary B-tree, which is a clever abstraction of a B-tree of order 4. Andersson trees are a simplification of the symmetric binary B-tree that use a B-tree of order 3 to remove several unpleasant cases in the implementation. If the last two sentences meant absolutely nothing to you, that's okay. This background isn't necessary to understand Andersson trees or implement them well. Andersson trees were introduced by Arne Andersson in his paper “Balanced Search Trees Made Simple”. They were further studied by a few people, most notably Mark Allen Weiss, who discussed them briefly in his books on data structures and algorithm analysis.

This tutorial will cover everything that they did and more. Personally, I found Arne's paper to be somewhat incomplete and Mark's descriptions to add very little (and nothing that could not be easily gleaned from Arne's paper). So the intention of this tutorial is to cover Andersson trees more thoroughly and with practical implementations in mind. I will introduce the same implementation that both Andersson and Weiss described as well as several other implementations that I believe simplify the algorithms by using more conventional methods. I will also introduce a non-recursive implementation which has sadly been missing from descriptions and implementations of the Andersson tree.
