Hello! This is **Neevek**, I just wrote this static site generator - **Minerl**.

**Minerl** includes the following features:

- tagging
- archiving
- markdown & perl support
- many others for you to explore

go get it [here](https://github.com/neevek).

Let's write some code:

    public static void main (String args []) {
        System.out.println("hello world"); 
    }

This is `inline` code.
