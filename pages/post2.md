Here follows some **markdown**, a link to [Google](http://www.google.com).

Convenience: Most scripting languages are dynamically typed. You can usually create new variables without declaring the variable type, and you can reuse variables to store objects of different types. Also, scripting languages tend to perform many type conversions automatically, for example, converting the number 10 to the text "10" as necessary.
Developing rapid prototypes: You can avoid the edit-compile-run cycle and just use edit-run!
Application extension/customization: You can "externalize" parts of your application - like configuration scripts, business logic/rules and math expressions for financial applications.
"Command line" shells for applications -for debugging, runtime/deploy time configuration etc. Most applications have a web-based GUI configuaration tool these days. But sysadmins/deployers frequently prefer command line tools. Instead of inventing ad-hoc scripting language for that purpose, a "standard" scripting language can be used.

*Perl is really cool!!!*
