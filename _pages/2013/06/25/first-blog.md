I didn't mean to reinvent the wheel by writing this tool, I just wanted to contribute something useful to the community after having learnt the *Perl* language for quite a while. 

It is another cool static site generator that you must try, it brings you some awesome features that you may never see in other implementations, and more features will be added continuously.

Fork it on [github](https://github.com/neevek).
